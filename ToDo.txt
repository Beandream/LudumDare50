Theme: Delay the inevitable

The Idea - RainStorm:

    Start at a lower tutorial section.
    collect materials to build up to higher level scaffolding that has more resources.

    Find materials in floating islands or other structures.
    going left or rigt give more resouces going up is safer.

    the higher you go up the less resouces there are.
    eventually getting impossible to build new structures.

    items will float in the water. so staying near the water is beneficial until it starts raining.

    inventory just based on weight?
    that way crafting doesn't make you drop items it all weighs the same.

    Maybe hunger?
    thirst?
    dampness? keep out of rain under cover?
    sanity?. keep in the light.

    Craftable scaffolding:
        Tall Platform up with ladder.
        Wide Platform off to the side.
        Square Platform up or to side with crafting table and roof.

    craftable materials:
        nails from metal scraps
        planks from logs.
        sticks from plants.
        rope from something.

    craftable Items:
        spyglass:
            moves your camera off towards the direction you use the spyglass.
        grappling hook:
            makes moving around easier and faster.
        Weather radio thing?:
            tell you when it will raind and roughly how much rain?
        Torches?:
            to light up platforms to keep sanity? and also to see.
        campfire:
            for healing and drying off if wet. also works as light.
        
    Example level:
                _
               | |
        [X] _ [__]
           | |
           | |

    rising water. delay by building platforms and buildings
        rain starts raining as a warning of water level rising. 
        water then raises by a large amount. 
        So you have to have prepared.
        prepare by building upwards with materials.
        collect materials when it is not raining.
        growing trees maybe? for wood materials?
        growing rocks? you know. like a normal thing to do.
        maybe have food and thirst.
        starts with a ton of resources but as you go up you have less resources.
        making a building game sounds miseriable tho.




Ideas:

    Spread Lights (Fire) from torch to torch, until they all burn out.
        start with at a fire gem of sorts.
        spread the fire to fireplaces and torches and lanterns.
        they will all slowly burn out.
        darkness hurts so you have to stay in the light.
        you need to go into the darkness to light new lights.
        firegem slowly loses health when there is not other fire(light) in the world.
        but you have to keep going further out into the darkness to find more things to light.
        the more lights there are the more health the gem has.
